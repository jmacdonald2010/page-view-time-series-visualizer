Got the other chart to work and got it to plot w/ a subplot. I think I have everything I need to run the test. Curious to see what's not right; got a feeling it probably won't like me using pandas built-in plotting methods for charts.

Figured out how to chart the first chart for years (need to still add a title). Need to figure out how to get both charts on the same figure, but before that, I need to make sure I can plot the other chart.

Added the second bar chart code to the .py file. I'm not sure if I'll need to adjust the yticks for this chart yet, but I guess I'll find out when I run the test. Starting the seaborn plot, but I know this will take a while since I really have no idea how to use seaborn.

My changes contain what I think either is or is very close to the example two chart. Sketches contain the chart and other code cells required to manipulate/pivot the data accordingly.

Working on creating the bar chart. Figured out how to sum values by month, now working on how to plot it so all months are grouped by year. 

## 03/25/2021 19:22
Created the line plot function.

## 03/23/2021 22:05
Started coding. Currently, the csv is read into a dataframe, and we remove the top and bottom 2.5% of values to clean the data. Last commit/push of the night.
